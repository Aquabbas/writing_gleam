# writing_gleam

- `Gleam` is a statically typed, functional language that compiles to `Erlang` and
  `JavaScript`. It's quite new (roughly one year old at the time of writing: `v1.11.1`).
  It drew me in mainly because of its compiler (which reminds me of `Elm` and `Rust`),
  its simplicity, its developer tooling, and its developer-first
  commitment. Plus, I've seen/heard the core maintainer ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))
  and some core team members (such as [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri)),
  and I really loved their enthusiasm, energy, and passion about the language.
  This repo aims to familiarize myself with the language and its ecosystem.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
